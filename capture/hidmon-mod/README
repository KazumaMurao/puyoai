Wii controller emulator

This program is currently based on HIDmon.
Do not redistribute.

* Usage

Connect the device before running.

./puyo

Reads stdin line by line, then outputs keys.
Blank line releases all keys.

Currently, each line has a constant duration.
For example, this input presses down key for T*2 seconds, then releases key for T seconds.

I once tried with T=1/60 sec., but Wii sometimes missed some inputs. I think
it exceeds key sampling frequency of either Wii controller, Classic Controller,
or VCA.
It was OK with 1/40 sec.

Each line can have up to 2 numbers. If two numbers were given, the two keys will be pressed simultaneously.

Please see wiiController.c for detail.

* Known issues
- Unstable output right after the startup of the program.
