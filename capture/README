This directory is only for Linux.

You need following packages to make everything:

- ffmpeg
- v4l2
- SDL
- SDL_image
- SDL_ttf
- gflags
- glog
- gtest

Note that you may need to install glog from source code as most
distributors don't link glog with gflags. Please install it by

svn checkout http://google-glog.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ google-glog-read-only
cd google-glog-read-only
./configure
make
sudo make install


If you are using PCA-DAV2, you need recent kernel (my kernel is 3.6.11,
and it didn't work with 2.x) and run modprobe with card=19 option:

$ sudo modprobe em28xx card=19

As resolution negotiation isn't implemented yet, you need to run

$ xawtv -device /dev/video0

to adjust the resolution of driver.
